# Welcome to Social-ize Cloud

You don't want to spend time building social networking features, so we built it for you. Here, you can build an entire forum, chat, and comment sections with just a few lines of code. We provide extremely simple APIs to get you started. 

## Features

- **Forum**: Create a forum for your users to discuss topics. Users can react and comments to other people's posts and comments. You define the structure of the forum by defining categories using tags. 
- **Chat**: Create a chat room for your users to communicate in real-time. Users can send messages, images, and files.
- **Commenting**: Add comments to any part of your app. Users can react and reply to comments.
- **Components**: If you don't want to build your UI, we also have prebuild interface components that can be served through `iframe`. You don't need to pay extra for this. 

## Pricing

The pricing model is extremely simple. We charge you based on the storage space you use. For some more advanced features (that are computation-heavy), we also charge you based on the number of requests you make. But trust us, this is cheaper than building these features yourself.
